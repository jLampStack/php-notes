   # Project in folder 'include-require'

   # Allow us to insert php code markup text into another php file saving a tonne of time and repeating a tonne of code

   # Look in website 1 folder for examples

   # require() stops script and gives fatal error  if error is found

   # include() is more lenient, it will give a warning if error is found but will continue to run the  script

   # require_once() is identical to require except php will check the file to see if it's already been included and if it has it won't include it again.
